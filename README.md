# Angular Quiz App

This project is a fun quiz app based on the BuzzFeed survey style. It allows users to answer a series of questions and provides a result based on their choices. If you are looking to explore Angular components, services, and user interactions, this project serves as a practical example.

## Project Structure

- **quiz.component.ts**: This file contains the implementation of the `QuizComponent`, an Angular component responsible for rendering quiz questions, options, and displaying the result based on user choices.

- **quiz.component.html**: The HTML template for the `QuizComponent`. It includes the layout for presenting quiz questions, options, and displaying the final result.

- **quiz_questions.json**: The JSON file that defines the quiz structure, including questions, options, and result messages.
